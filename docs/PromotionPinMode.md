# Com.Sajari.Sdk.Model.PromotionPinMode
 - PIN: The pin applies regardless of whether the pinned item is in the underlying result set of the search.  This has the net effect that a search result can be surfaced even if it was not originally a part of the search result set.  - PROMOTE: The pin only applies if the pinned item is in the underlying result set of the search.
